# SQL-Basics-with-Healthcare-Data

I recently completed the "SQL Basics with Healthcare Data" tutorial by Data Wizardry on YouTube, where I gained hands-on experience with SQL exercises using healthcare datasets. During the course, I developed proficiency in key SQL functions including SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, and JOIN. These exercises enabled me to effectively query, filter, group, and combine data, enhancing my understanding of data analysis in the context of healthcare. This training has sharpened my skills in SQL and deepened my ability to work with real-world data scenarios.
